# Project Description
The report provides a statistical summary of the features in the energy consumption dataset. Furthermore, the report describes the correlation between energy use intensity and the feature variables. 
We also take a look at whether energy use intensity reduces before greenmark status is awarded. The report walks through each feature and the conclusion.
